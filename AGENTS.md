# AGENTS.md

Operating manual for AI coding agents (and humans) contributing to **australian-kpis**.

This file complements:
- [`Spec.md`](./Spec.md) — architecture, data model, testing strategy (ground truth)
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — human-oriented workflow

If anything here conflicts with `Spec.md`, **`Spec.md` wins** — file a PR to fix this doc.

---

## 1. Orientation (read this first)

- **Project**: unified Rust API + TypeScript SDK + Python PDF sidecar for Australian economic data (ABS, RBA, APRA, Treasury, ASX, AEMO, state govts).
- **Status**: pre-implementation. Work is scoped into 65 GitHub issues across milestones **M1–M5**.
- **Ground truth**: [`Spec.md`](./Spec.md) (~1300 lines). Skim the TOC; jump to the section relevant to your task. Don't invent architecture — if the spec is silent, propose an amendment PR to `Spec.md` alongside the change.

## 2. Repo layout

See `Spec.md § Monorepo layout`. In short:

```
crates/            Rust workspace (domain, db, adapter, api-http, loader, ...)
crates/adapters/   One crate per source (ABS, RBA, APRA, ...)
crates/bins/       Binaries: au-kpis-api, au-kpis-ingestion, au-kpis-scheduler, au-kpis-cli
apps/web/          TypeScript reference client (Vite + React)
apps/pdf-extractor/  Python sidecar (FastAPI + pdfplumber + camelot)
apps/bench/        k6 load-test scripts
packages/sdk/      TypeScript SDK (@au-kpis/sdk)
packages/sdk-generated/  OpenAPI-generated client + types
tools/             Codegen + admin scripts
infra/             docker-compose, Dockerfiles, sqlx migrations
tests/             Cross-crate e2e, chaos, contract tests
```

## 3. Finding work

1. **Check the issue board first**: [milestones](https://github.com/ponderingdemocritus/australian-kpis/milestones). Pick an issue with no unmet dependencies.
2. **Respect `Depends on:` lines** in issue bodies. Do not start a blocked issue.
3. **Claim it** by assigning yourself (or linking the branch you create).
4. Each issue's **Pass requirements** checklist is the contract. Every box must be ticked before merge.

### Writing good GitHub issues

If you're creating or rewriting an issue, write it as an **execution contract**, not a brainstorm. A good issue should let an agent or human implement the change without guessing architecture, hidden requirements, or where the code belongs.

**Every implementation issue should contain these sections:**

| Section | What it must say |
|---|---|
| **Context** | One short paragraph: what problem this solves and why it matters |
| **Spec anchors** | Exact `Spec.md` sections that govern the work |
| **Scope** | What this issue implements in this PR-sized slice |
| **Out of scope** | Explicitly list nearby work that is **not** part of this issue |
| **Pass requirements** | Flat checklist of verifiable outcomes; this is the merge contract |
| **Files/modules likely touched** | Expected crates, apps, workflows, docs, or migrations |
| **Dependencies** | `Blocked by:` and `Blocks:` lines that reflect actual sequencing |
| **Test requirements** | The exact test layers required by `Spec.md § Testing strategy` |
| **Estimated effort** | `S`, `M`, `L`, or `XL`; if `XL`, split before implementation |

**Rules for writing pass requirements:**

1. Anchor each requirement to the spec. If a requirement extends the spec, amend `Spec.md` in the same PR or issue rewrite.
2. Write outcomes, not implementation trivia. Prefer "returns 429 with `Retry-After`" over "use crate X".
3. Keep the issue PR-sized. Target one crate, one workflow, one adapter, or one user-visible feature slice.
4. Do not bundle unrelated surfaces. Backend API + dashboard UI + ops automation is usually too much for one issue.
5. Do not require live-upstream tests unless the spec explicitly calls for them; prefer fixtures, `wiremock`, and `testcontainers`.
6. State performance budgets, response formats, and error semantics explicitly when they matter.
7. Name migrations, OpenAPI changes, docs updates, or fixture additions when they are part of the contract.
8. If an issue changes architecture or introduces a new endpoint not already in `Spec.md`, the issue must say so and require a spec amendment.
9. If an issue is a tracker or umbrella, say that clearly in the title/body and do **not** assign it to a coding agent as if it were an implementation ticket.

**Template**

```md
## Context

<1 short paragraph>

## Spec anchors

- `Spec.md § ...`
- `Spec.md § ...`

## Scope

- ...

## Out of scope

- ...

## Pass requirements

- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

## Files/modules likely touched

- `crates/...`
- `apps/...`

## Dependencies

- Blocked by: #...
- Blocks: #...

## Test requirements

- Unit: ...
- Integration: ...
- Contract/E2E/bench: ...

## Estimated effort

M (≤3d)
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**

- Vague goals like "support X" without naming endpoints, crates, fixtures, or tests
- "And also" scope creep into dashboards, docs sites, alerts, and deployment wiring
- Issue bodies that contradict `Spec.md`
- `XL` issues assigned directly to an implementer instead of being split first
- Pass requirements that depend on flaky external systems when local fixtures would do
- Checklists that mention outputs but not the tests needed to prove them

## 4. Setup (one-time)

```bash
# Rust toolchain is pinned in rust-toolchain.toml
rustup show      # installs the pinned version

# Tooling
cargo install sqlx-cli cargo-nextest cargo-deny cargo-audit cargo-llvm-cov critcmp

# TS
corepack enable && pnpm install

# Pre-commit hooks
brew install lefthook && lefthook install

# Local infra
docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
sqlx migrate run
```

If any of these fail on first run — don't paper over it; fix the underlying setup issue and update this doc if needed.

## 5. Development loop

```
1. git switch -c <github-handle>/<issue-number>-<short-slug>
2. cargo check + cargo test (fast feedback in the affected crate)
3. Implement smallest change that satisfies the issue's Pass requirements
4. Run local pre-flight checks (see § 6)
5. Push and open a PR (see § 7)
6. Wait for CI; fix gates; get review
7. Merge via merge queue
```

### Branch naming

- `<handle>/<issue>-<slug>` (e.g., `ponderingdemocritus/27-loader-copy-upsert`)
- Lowercase, kebab-case, under 50 chars total
- One issue per branch

## 6. Pre-flight checks (before pushing)

**Run this block every time.** If any fail, fix before pushing — CI will reject them anyway.

```bash
# Rust
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo nextest run --workspace
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace        # if queries changed

# TypeScript
pnpm run lint
pnpm turbo run typecheck test

# Supply chain (catches bad deps before CI)
cargo deny check
cargo audit
gitleaks protect --staged             # pre-commit runs this too

# OpenAPI drift (if you touched handlers or schemas)
cargo run -p au-kpis-openapi > openapi.json
oasdiff breaking openapi-main.json openapi.json    # must be empty
```

**Lefthook** runs `cargo fmt --check`, `biome format --check`, `gitleaks protect`, and a >5 MB file block on every commit. Don't disable it.

## 7. PR rules

### Required

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **One issue per PR** | Title prefixed with issue number: `fix(loader): revision chain tiebreak (#27)` |
| **Closes keyword** | Body contains `Closes #N` so the issue auto-closes on merge |
| **Pass requirements checklist** | Copy the issue's checklist into the PR body; tick what you did |
| **Test plan** | Concrete steps to verify; unit + integration |
| **Spec impact** | Confirm "No Spec changes required" OR link amendment PR |
| **Signed commits** | `git config commit.gpgsign true` — required on `main` |
| **Conventional commit title** | `type(scope): subject` where type ∈ `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `docs`, `chore`, `security` |

### Size + scope

- **Target ≤400 lines changed.** Bigger → split.
- **No drive-by refactors.** Unrelated cleanup goes in its own PR.
- **No new dependencies** without a comment explaining why an existing dep doesn't work. `cargo deny` rejects GPL-incompatible licenses.

### What reviewers look for

- The diff delivers exactly the issue's pass requirements — no more, no less
- Tests added for new behaviour; property/snapshot tests where applicable
- Error paths handled with `thiserror` (libs) / `anyhow` (bins) — no `.unwrap()` in non-test code
- No lock held across `.await` (clippy catches it; don't silence the lint)
- No secrets or real production data in fixtures

### Automated review guidance

- Prioritise correctness, security, data integrity, CI regressions, and spec drift over style commentary
- Flag missing tests for behaviour changes, migrations, API changes, or workflow logic as at least P1
- Flag missing `Spec.md` updates when a PR changes the CI contract or other architecture-level behaviour
- Ignore formatting-only nits unless they block understanding of the diff

## 8. CI rules (what must pass)

Full details in `Spec.md § CI/CD pipeline`. Summary:

### PR flow (blocking — all 14 gates)

| # | Gate | Tool | Fail condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Compile | `cargo check --workspace` | error |
| 2 | Lint | `cargo clippy -D warnings` + `pnpm run lint` | any warning |
| 3 | Format | `cargo fmt --check` + `biome format --check` | diff |
| 4 | Tests | `nextest` + `vitest` + Playwright | fail or flake (retry >0) |
| 5 | Coverage | `cargo-llvm-cov` | <80% line or <70% branch |
| 6 | Snapshots | `insta` | drift without review commit |
| 7 | OpenAPI diff | `oasdiff breaking` | any breaking change without `/v2` |
| 8 | Contract | `schemathesis` | violation |
| 9 | Supply chain | `cargo audit`, `cargo deny`, `pnpm audit` | critical CVE or banned license |
| 10 | Container | `trivy` | HIGH/CRITICAL |
| 11 | Secrets | `gitleaks` | any finding |
| 12 | Bench | `critcmp` | >5% regression |
| 13 | Smoke | `k6 smoke.js` | threshold miss |
| 14 | Accessibility | `axe-core` | any WCAG AA violation |

**Target wall time: <5 min on warm cache.** If your PR slows CI materially, surface it in the PR description.

### Merge queue (blocking, runs once per batch)

- Playwright full suite
- k6 `smoke.js` against staging
- `schemathesis` deep fuzz
- Bench regression (no longer advisory)

Merge queue **ejects the entire batch** on failure. Respect the queue — don't force-push to bypass.

### Scheduled (non-blocking, but watch for alerts)

- k6 `sustained.js` + `burst.js` nightly in staging
- `cargo fuzz run` 30 min/target nightly
- `cargo mutants` weekly
- Renovate weekly dependency PRs

## 9. Commit style

```
type(scope): short imperative subject (≤72 chars)

Optional body explaining *why*. Wrap at 72 cols.

Optional footer:
Closes #N
```

- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `docs`, `chore`, `security`
- Scope: crate name or directory (`loader`, `adapter-abs`, `sdk`, `infra`)
- Never attribute to Claude / Copilot / any tool — commits are authored by the human or machine identity that runs them. See `.claude/rules/git-commits.md` if you use the repo's `/commit` skill.

## 10. Code style

### Rust

- `rustfmt` defaults + `clippy::pedantic` aspirations (not enforced today; `clippy::all -D warnings` is)
- `#[tracing::instrument]` on public async functions
- `async-trait` only for dyn-dispatched traits (adapters); otherwise native async-fn
- Errors: `thiserror` in libraries, `anyhow` in binaries. No `Box<dyn Error>`.
- **Never** hold a lock across `.await`. `clippy::await_holding_lock` is denied.
- Prefer `sqlx::query!` (compile-checked) over `query()` (runtime-checked).
- Streams over `Vec` for anything over ~1000 items.

### TypeScript

- Biome defaults
- `type` > `interface` for unions; `interface` for extensible object shapes
- No default exports from barrel files
- No `any`; `unknown` if truly unknown, then narrow
- Runtime validation only at process boundaries (SDK ↔ server); trust internal TS types

### Python (PDF sidecar)

- `ruff` + `mypy --strict`
- `httpx` over `requests`
- Explicit timeouts on every network call

### Migrations

- One SQL file per change, numbered (`0007_add_series_updated_at.sql`)
- **Reversible where possible** — `.up.sql` + `.down.sql` pair
- Test: `sqlx migrate run` → `sqlx migrate revert` → `sqlx migrate run` leaves schema identical
- No destructive changes without a deprecation window and explicit `Spec.md` note

## 11. Testing expectations (see `Spec.md § Testing strategy`)

Every PR must add/update tests at the appropriate layer:

| Change type | Required test |
|---|---|
| New pure fn | Unit test |
| New parser | Snapshot test + property test |
| New API endpoint | Integration test via testcontainers + schemathesis coverage |
| New SQL query | Integration test hitting real PG+Timescale |
| New SDK method | SDK integration test against compose stack |
| New adapter | Golden-file `insta` snapshot + `wiremock`-based integration |
| UI change | Playwright E2E + axe-core pass |
| Performance-sensitive path | Criterion bench + committed baseline |

**Coverage floor**: 80% line / 70% branch across shipped crates. PR bot comments with the diff.

**Zero-flake policy**: any CI retry auto-files a `flaky`-labelled issue. Fix within 48h or delete the test.

## 12. Agent-specific pitfalls (avoid these)

1. **Don't regenerate `openapi.json` without proposing the handler change.** The order is: change handler → regen → commit both. Drift between them fails CI.
2. **Don't mock what you can testcontainer.** We have working testcontainers for PG+Timescale, Redis, MinIO. Use them.
3. **Don't add comments that narrate what the code does.** Only write a comment if the *why* is non-obvious (workaround, hidden invariant, surprising behaviour).
4. **Don't introduce backward-compat shims.** We're pre-`v1`. Just change the code.
5. **Don't batch unrelated changes.** The loader upsert fix and the API pagination bug are two PRs.
6. **Don't claim completion without ticking every pass-requirement box.** If you can't finish a box, leave it unticked, add a note explaining why, and leave the PR in draft.
7. **Don't silence clippy/biome lints** with `#[allow(...)]` without a comment naming the reason. CI flags bare allows in review.
8. **Don't bypass pre-commit hooks** with `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
9. **Don't commit secrets, `.env`, production fixtures, or large binaries.** Fixtures >5 MB go to R2 with a reference in-repo.
10. **When unsure about architecture**, open a draft PR with a `Spec.md` amendment — don't guess.
11. **Validate artifact provenance in parsers.** If parsed observations carry `source_artifact_id`, verify the artifact id, persisted storage key, and parsed bytes are consistent before emitting rows. Do not trust an `ArtifactRef` whose fields could point at different blobs.
12. **Reject ambiguous source/dataflow provenance.** Source-specific parsers must fail fast when the artifact cannot be tied to the expected upstream dataflow. Do not infer CPI/WPI/etc. only from payload shape or a mirrored filename.
13. **Keep streaming fixes on the hot path.** Handling harmless format variations, such as JSON key reordering, should not introduce extra full-artifact scans unless the issue explicitly accepts that cost and tests cover it.
14. **Make performance fixtures production-shaped.** Large-memory and streaming tests should use valid content-addressed artifact ids and storage keys so they exercise the same validation path as production parsing.

## 13. When stuck

1. **Re-read the relevant `Spec.md` section** — it's usually already answered there
2. **Search closed issues + merged PRs** for similar precedent
3. **Open a draft PR** with your best attempt and `@`-mention CODEOWNERS
4. **Amend `Spec.md`** if the spec genuinely doesn't cover your case

## 14. Release process (M5+)

- **API**: additive changes auto-deploy on merge to `main`. Breaking changes require a new `/v2` path + 6-month `/v1` deprecation window with `Deprecation` + `Sunset` headers (RFC 8594).
- **SDK**: semver via `@changesets/cli`. Every PR touching `packages/sdk` requires a changeset file. Release workflow publishes on merge.
- **Monorepo tags**: `api-vX.Y.Z`, `sdk-vX.Y.Z`, `ingestion-vX.Y.Z` — tagged independently.

Rollback on prod smoke failure is **automatic**. If you need a manual rollback: one-click Slack action or `fly releases rollback <app>`.

---

**TL;DR for an agent starting fresh:**

1. Read the relevant `Spec.md` section for your task
2. Pick an unblocked GitHub issue; respect dependencies
3. Branch, implement the smallest change that ticks every pass-requirement box
4. Run the § 6 pre-flight block locally
5. PR with `Closes #N`, checklist ticked, test plan
6. Wait for 14 CI gates to go green; fix what's red
7. Merge via queue
